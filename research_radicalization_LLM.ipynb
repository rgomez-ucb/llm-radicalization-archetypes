    "Specifically, the model of choice is[Llama-2-7B-Chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf) model trained and release by Meta as part of the [Llama family of models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama_(language_model)). This model is an open-source 7-billion parameter language model that has been fine-tuned for conversational contexts. While its capabilities are more limited than today's frontier models, it is suitable for a study on advice giving. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notes from developers about the model's training data:\n",
    "> Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.\n",

There is no single profile that determines if someone is on the verge of radicalization so these identities focus on a rising vulnerable population in the U.S., young men.

I created then recreated the three identities several times to try to understand how the model behaves before moving on to the next sedctions of the assignment. Another challenges was my attempt to mirror an aggressive emotional state like someone that is too far gone from being helped. The model responded empathetically. This identity really didnt do much so I attempted to see if geographic location would affect the model's response. The biggest challenge was my attempt to get the model to weight another variable higher than tone to generate a response against. "
